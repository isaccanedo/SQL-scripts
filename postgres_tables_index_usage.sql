-- PostgreSQL % of times indexes are used on tables by table size descending (might want to tweak to list by % descending)
--
-- If not near 99% index usage on tables > 10,000 rows, consider adding an index to match your query patterns (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY in prod to avoid locking table)
--
-- Tested on PostgreSQL 8.4, 9.x, 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.0

SELECT
  relname AS table,
  100 * idx_scan / GREATEST(seq_scan + idx_scan, 1) AS percent_of_times_index_used,
  n_live_tup AS rows_in_table
FROM
  pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE
  seq_scan + idx_scan > 0
ORDER BY
  rows_in_table DESC,
  percent_of_times_index_used DESC;
